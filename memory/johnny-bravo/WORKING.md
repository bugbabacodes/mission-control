## Research Questions for Ishan

Before I dive deep into building the lead list, I need some clarifications:

### 1. Industry Focus
- What industries should I prioritize? (e.g., fintech, healthcare, e-commerce, SaaS, entertainment)
- Any industries to avoid?

### 2. Company Stage/Size
- Are you looking for pre-seed, seed, or Series A+ founders?
- Solo founders only, or small teams (2-5 people) okay?
- Any specific revenue thresholds? (e.g., $10K+ MRR, bootstrapped with budget)

### 3. Geography
- Any geographical preferences? (US, Europe, APAC, global)
- Time zone considerations for collaboration?

### 4. Red Flags to Avoid
- What signals indicate someone is NOT a good fit?
- Any personality types or company types you want to skip?

### 5. Your Unique Value Prop
- What's your "special sauce" — the one thing that makes you different from other consultants?
- What do clients typically say they love most about working with you?

### 6. Past Success Stories
- Can you share 2-3 quick examples of "dream clients" you've worked with?
- What made them ideal?

### 7. Outreach Preferences
- Do you prefer warm intros, cold outreach, or a mix?
- Any platforms you want to focus on? (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, IndieHackers, etc.)
- Your preferred outreach style? (Direct, value-first, relationship-building)

## Research Notes

### Where to Find Leads
Potential hunting grounds to explore:
- **LinkedIn:** Founders posting about hiring, tech challenges, growth
- **Twitter/X:** Indie hackers, builders sharing their journey
- **IndieHackers:** Product launches, milestone posts
- **Product Hunt:** New launches needing technical execution
- **Y Combinator:** Recent batches, job posts
- **Startup job boards:** Founder postings indicating gaps

### Outreach Angle Ideas
- "Zero to one execution partner" — bridge idea to shipped product
- Web3/AI specialization with 100+ projects shipped
- Tech + design combo (rare find)
- Fractional CTO/execution arm for non-technical founders
